# Learning VI editor
# Assuming you are familiar with basics of vi editor modes -> Command, Insert, Append and Replace
# This is simplest way worked for me for remembering 

# movement and inserting
up -  k
down - j
left - h
right - l

gg - go to first line of the page 
G -  go to last line of the page
Go - to to last last line and open a new line
O - insert new line above the cursor
^ (shift key) - go to beginning of the line
$ (shift key) - go to end of the line

I - insert at the beginning of the line
A - append at the end of the line
a - append after the cursor

:n - go to line n
example :23 - to go to 23 line
tip: :se nu - sets the line numbers to the file

e - jump from word to word 

# replacing (by pressing keys below given)
r - replacing character
cw - change word 
cc - change line

# deleting 
(replacing and deleting are similar in some way but usability differs)
x - delete character
dw - delete word
dd - delete line

# copy and paste
# copy
examples:
copy word - yw (note: the cursor should be at the start of word to copy a specific word)
copy line  - yy

example copy and paste a line: 
we copy line -> this is the time to do 
* cursor is now on 't' in 'this'
* press yy - line copied
* lets say we paste it on a new line below to it.
* press 'o' and then esc
* press P (shift+p) - it is capital p
* now a new line is pasted just below to it
#Paste
p - paste after cursor
P - Paste before cursor

# undow and redo
u - undo
ctrl+r - redo

# copy block of lines 
* as we do in word document with 'shift+ up arrow' to select lines
* and after that ctrl+c and ctrl+v

* the lines to be copied
 the first line to copy
 the second line to copy
 the third line to copy
 
-> to copy from bottom to up where the cursor is present
v3k - visual - 3 lines - k for up 
-> to copy from top to bottom
v3j - visual - 3 lines - j for down

* press 'y' for the lines to be yanked/copied
* by pressing - p or P - paste where needed
* by pressing 'u' we do undo if unsatisfied with paste operation

#save and quit
:w save 
:wq write/save and quit
:q quit
:q! do not save changes
:wq! force write and quit

# searching - similar to ctrl+f in word 
/{pattern}- called forward search
?{pattern}
n - search moves down
N - search moves up

#find and replace
:s{old}/{new}/options - find and replace on current line
:%s{old}/{new}/options - find and replace in the entire document
In the latter ':%s...' the 'g' option substitures all the occurances on a line
