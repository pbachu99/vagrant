* some alias that were set are below: 
* The env directory has sh scripts for start and stop vagrant boxes
* For example, starting and stopping the entire RAC or Dataguard takes time, so it is better to script
```
$ alias
alias rac='cd /d/git/vagrant/rac/'
alias shs='cd /d/git/vagrant/env'
alias vg='cd /d/git/vagrant/'
```
