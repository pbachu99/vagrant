## spin up multi Oracle Linux 7 servers. In this case we setup 3 servers 
## inside oracle-linux7 directory
cd oracle-linux7/

mkdir multi-oracle-oracle7
cd multi-oracle7/

## the vagrant file has the details to setup or spin up 3 servers
## issuing the command -- vagrant up -- will start the setup

## check the machine names using: 
* vagrant status

# Note: the passwords for vagrant and root is 'vagrant'

## in this case it shows up 3 vms, as:  admin, server1 and server2
## connecting individual servers 
  
 vagrant ssh admin
# 'exit' to exit connection from admin server
 
 vagrant ssh server1
 vagrant ssh server2

# to shut down servers to connect and use again we use
 vagrant halt
 
# using this command all the 3 servers are deleted. Obviously using 'vagrant up' again the 3 servers created 
 vagrant destroy -f
