# to allow SSH between the vagrant boxes using host only adapter requires some changes

# Firewall port 22 was open on windows pc (check the incomming and outgoing port is opened or not for you)
# Navigation: Firewall&Network protection -> advanced settings

# three vagrant boxes setup already
# vagrant status
admin
server1
server2

# The entry - virtualbox__intnet: "private" - is in vagrant file for private network setup
# which is from # Tim Hall of oraclebase " 
# connect first to admin vagrant box
vagrant ssh admin
# Pinging all the three IPs
ping -c 3  IP

# Add the entries in hosts file on all the 3 servers in case two way SSH required
echo 'ip admin' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo 'ip server1' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo 'ip server2' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts 
# check hosts file
more /etc/hosts

# ping check with hostname
ping -c 3 server1
ping -c 3 server2

vagrant@admin:~$ ssh server1
...
vagrant@server1's password:
# it will ask for vagrant user password on server1. The password is vagrant
# type - yes - to add connecting
vagrant@server1:~$ 
# exit to exit server1

#### on server1 ####
# if hosts file has not entries.. it throws the below error
vagrant@server1:~$ ssh admin
ssh: Could not resolve hostname admin: Name or service not known...

# Add the entries in hosts file on server1... 
echo 'ip admin' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo 'ip server1' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo 'ip server2' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts 
# check hosts file
more /etc/hosts

# connect to admin with ssh admin
...
vagrant@admin's password:
# it will ask for vagrant user password on server1. The password is vagrant
# type - yes - to add connecting

vagrant@admin:~$ exit
Connection to admin closed.
vagrant@server1:~$

#### on server2 ####
same steps to be repeated as it was for server1

###### cofigure SSH without password #########

# on admin server
ssh-keygen
press enter key - 3 times - 

# we copy this password file to server1
ssh-copy-id server1
yes 
enter password for vagrant which is 'vagrant'

# check 
ssh server1 
ssh server1 hostname
# Now SSH connectivity should establish without password

# ssh copy to server2
ssh-copy-id server2
ssh server2
